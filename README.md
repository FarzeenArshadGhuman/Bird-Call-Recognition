# Bird-Call-Recognition
This is a Bird Sound Classifying Deep Learning model, which takes in bird sounds, converts them into spectograms, and then classifies those images based on what type of bird call it is. 

The data is from: https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4g8b7/1

It gives around 80% accuracy.
